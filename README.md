# security-camera-manager
Program to manage security cameras and video files.

Currently the files are messy and unorganized, which will eventually be fixed. I have created files to test systems that I plan on adding to the overall program. The main files are gui, camera, camera_manager, and file_manager. In addition, there are some comments explaining code, but as of now there are a lot of commented out lines of code for experimentation or testing. This will all eventually be cleaned up and commented properly.

The program works with a gui by giving you an option to pick from a list of cameras on a menu screen. These options are determined in a file that represents the cameras available on your computer. In the future I plan to add the ability to connect cameras wirelessly. Once the camera is selected, the view of that camera as well as a properties window will be switched to in the gui. The properties save to a settings file that will save between program runs.
